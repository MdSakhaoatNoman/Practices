    <p>Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version
      of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through
      prophets <br>such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.Muslims
      consider the Quran, in Arabic, to be the unaltered and
      final revelation of God.Like other Abrahamic religions,<br>
      Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous
      rewarded in paradise and the unrighteous punished in hell.<br>
      Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam,
      which are obligatory acts of worship,
      as well as following Islamic law (sharia),<br>
      which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society,
      from banking and welfare to women and the environment.<br>
      The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.
